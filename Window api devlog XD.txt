-----------------------
These were the dev status of the API
It only has unorganised informations, that I wrote for myself

THIS IS NOT A PROPER DOCUMENTATION OR BUG LIST. I WILL CREATE THOSE IN THEIR OWN FILE.
-----------------------

Tic80 window library development status:

pos translations		working
clipping			working
window function calls		working
focusing windows		working
window resizing			working
window movement			working
restroring api functions	working
window button pressing		working
closing windows			working
fullscreen window		working
minimize windows		working
window titles			working
displaying windows		working
disable resizing		not tested
window tick object		working
plug in interface 		not implemented yet
proxy (to ensure functionality)	won't be implemented
fullscreen mode			won't be implemented
custom cursors			won't be implemented
button function			you can do it yourself :)
tooltips			won't be implemented
dragbox (helper for mobile user)won't be implemented
only the focused window has access to inputs -working
sound management/interface for it            -won't be implemented (maybe later, reason is to stop windows interfering each other)
peek/poke modification (for sound only)      -Ah yes.. no

in a nutsell:
displaying windows		working
moving&resizing windows		working
minimizing windows		working
maximizing windows		minor grphical changes are requied


Known bugs: (Outdated, see Known bugs.md for the new list)

bug with the focus		squashed
  -if you click inside the window then drag out of it, the program detects it as a new click (fixed :))
  -the window locks up after gaining focus (fixed :))
  -resizing sometimes slips out of the cursor's grab (severity:medium)(can't reproduce anymore)
out of bounds bug		kinda squashed
  -if you drag out of bounds the window at its 1st grabbable pixel, the window disappears, making it completely unreachable (severity:medium)
  -if you drag the left or top side out of bound, the window disappear (severity:low)
hitboxes need polishing		squashed
  -some hitboxes are not in the correct spot (severity:low)(fixed :))
window nudging bug		squashed
  -when moving the left or top side of a window too quickly, unexpected results happen (severity:high, at line 78)
no mouse blocking implemented
  -when you move the mouse while grabbing a corner to a point where the window supposed to reset, the non resetting value is inverted :P (severity: medium)

(bug severity meanings:
low: source is known, fix is aviable just not applied yet
medium: debugging is needed to locate the source
high: the debugging continously fails, needs to rewrite code and algorythm
not implemented: new code or algorythm is needed to achive the desired effect
unfixable: due to some limitation, this bug can't be fixed
)


used variables: C m w H K Z

window movement codes:
0: none
1: whole window
2: right side
3: left side
4: bottom side
5: top side
6: nw
7: se
8: sw
9: ne

`this` is the window object
windows.add(<window object>) opens and starts rendering the selected window object
windows.mini.push(window obj)
new Window(x,y,w,h,title,renderer function,buttons,frame color,inner color,update function,resizeable?,onclose function,focus gained function,focus lost function)
	Creates a Window object with the specified parameters.
	The parameters are:
	x: number; the x position of the upper left corner of the window.This value can be changed by dragging the window around.
	y: number; the y position of the upper left corner of the window.The value can be changed by the user like x.
	w: number; the initial width of the window. You can fix this value by setting the `resizeable` parameter to False, but by default this value can be changed by the user.
	h: number; the initial height of the window. behaves the same as the width.
